          <p>
            A white and illusory world, covered with soft and gentle snow. <br>
            Beneath the crisp powder lie elegant, charmingly blooming flowers,<br>
            their beautiful shapes and fragrance enwrapped in the shielding frosty white.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gentle gusts of a soft breeze<br>
            pick up crystals of flowery snow fragrance<br>
            and provide a clean, beautiful scent with a powdery warmth.
          </p>
          <p>
            These dancing motes of snow, <br>
			in a whirl of glittering ice crystals amid the warm sunlight,<br>
            sparkle with a sweet fragrance that overflows with translucency.
          </p>
          <p>
           The snow eventually melts,<br>
            blending with the fragrance of the flowers<br>
            and leaving fresh and pure reverberations behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The miraculous instant in which flowers and snow meet and resonate together. <br>
            This is the most beautiful and pure fragrance in the world,<br>
            like a vista of pure white that spreads into infinity.<br>
            This is the birth of JILL STUART Crystal Bloom Snow Eau de Parfum.

                  <p>
                    The name “jasmine” is said to come from the Persian “yasmin”, meaning “a gift from god.” Jasmine is known as the king of fragrances, and the flower is famous as the raw material for many perfumes and teas. In India it is known as the “flower of love,” with a tradition of using jasmine as decorations during weddings and including the meaning of “I will be with you.”

                  <p>
                    “Iris” means “rainbow” in Greek, and these flowers have rainbow like colors. In Greek mythology Iris was the “messenger who linked the earth and the heavens,” and rainbows are said to be the bridges that she used while doing so.

                  <p>
                    <br><br>Musk is often compared to a clean and fresh fragrance, such as “a smell like soap.” Has a soft, powdery fragrance that perfectly suits being worn on the skin, bringing you a feeling of cleanliness along with a comfortable warmth. Another appeal of musk is the soft and gentle feeling it provides, like your skin after just taking a bath.
